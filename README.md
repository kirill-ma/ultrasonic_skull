# ultrasonic_skull
I made this device for demonstration of ultrasound application at school master classes.
It's pretty simple. The closer you bring your hand, the more the skull opens its mouth)

I used Arduino nano and HC-SR04 ultrasonic rangefinder module and a servo motor. The device is 5V USB powered from external power bank. 
3D model is from [https://www.kevsrobots.com/blog/spooky-scary-skeleton.html](https://www.kevsrobots.com/blog/spooky-scary-skeleton.html) and I modified it. See 3D_print/ folder

I used VScode + PlatformIO + Arduino framework
